I’m interested in how people make decisions when the trade-offs matter and certainty isn’t available.

This site is where I explore those questions in public, through writing and the things I’m building, including Neighbourhood Finder. I also share occasional work from Descendants, a long-form fiction project that explores similar themes through a different lens.
