From my previous post on <a href="http://chadfield.org/work/my-progress-with-learning-mongo-and-ember" target="_blank">my learning progress</a>, you&#8217;ll know I was running through a few Ember tutorials. Through these I learnt a bit, but I wasn&#8217;t grasping Ember&#8217;s MVC concept with the single model example apps. I was starting to feel like an idiot.

Fortunately, an off topic comment on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com" target="_blank">Hacker News</a> lead to me pointing out the tutorial limitations. A kind gentleman pointed me to the <a href="https://peepcode.com/products/emberjs" target="_blank">Ember tutorial</a> on <a href="https://peepcode.com" target="_blank">PeepCode</a>. It was obvious from the description that this was exactly what I needed. There were screenshots of an example app with multiple associated models in the same view. Perfect.

Now that I&#8217;ve finished passively watching the lesson (not coding along), I know perfect is the perfect description. The tutorial didn&#8217;t only show how to create a multi-model app. That&#8217;s what I thought I needed. I really needed a solid explanation of the Ember basics. I needed to properly understand Ember&#8217;s MVC concept. I needed to be shown the automagic of Ember&#8217;s non-coding.

Summary: If you&#8217;re new to Ember start with <a href="https://peepcode.com/products/emberjs" target="_blank">PeepCode&#8217;s Ember tutorial</a>.
