About 10 days have past since we found out that we&#8217;re having a girl. We were waiting for over 3 months to find out. Waiting until the birth didn&#8217;t make sense. I still can&#8217;t imagine what it&#8217;s going to be like having this new person in our life. I&#8217;ve managed to avoid being around babies more almost my entire life. Vicky will make sure I&#8217;m not useless, and her family will be living in Melbourne by the time she&#8217;s due. That&#8217;s June, by the way. June 12th at this stage.

While I can&#8217;t imagine how our baby is going to change our lives, I do know I feel about it. I can imagine the presence of this perfect bundle of life&#8217;s potential. I can imagine the love, the joy and the challenges that will make life worthwhile and meaningful.

I can&#8217;t wait to meet you, darling
