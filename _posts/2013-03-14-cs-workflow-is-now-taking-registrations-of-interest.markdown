Copywriters can now register their interest for <a href="http://csworkflow.com" target="_blank">CS Workflow</a>. You can do that here: <a href="http://csworkflow.com" target="_blank">http://csworkflow.com</a>.

I&#8217;m building an application specially for copywriters to make the review and approval process as painless as possible. If you&#8217;re a copywriter or have managed content projects, you&#8217;ll know how hard it is to get good feedback from reviewers and compile all that feedback into changes.

CS Workflow will manage the process, guiding and teaching reviewers how to give great feedback. It is a web-based application, so it accessible from any Internet-enabled device. Integration with other services and platforms is straightforward, making importing and publishing content easy.

This service is inspired by a blog post by my good friend Max Johns about <a href="http://contentistheweb.com/giving-and-receiving-expert-feedback-on-web-copy" target="_blank">giving and receiving web copy feedback</a>.

The next step is a closed beta to perfect the feature set and process flow. Register you interest to receive an invite.

Feedback is always welcome and I&#8217;d love to hear more stories about your specific review situation. Email me at ben@csworkflow.com
