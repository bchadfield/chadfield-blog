I suck at following my own advice. <a href="http://csworkflow.com" target="_blank">CS Workflow&#8217;s website</a> is pretty bad, we&#8217;re not active on social media and the amount of content we&#8217;re producing is only slightly more than none (there&#8217;s good stuff in the pipeline).

I seem to forget the basics when working on my own projects. For an example on top of the one&#8217;s already given, I forgot to add authorisation to <a href="http://secretsanta.csworkflow.com" target="_blank">Blog Secret Santa</a> to stop people being able to edit each other&#8217;s account details. I fixed that a couple of hours after it went live, but still.

The point of this post wasn&#8217;t self deprecation, it was to remind myself of how much I get from giving other people feedback. I generally give feedback with the selfless intention of making the world better. I love startups, internet technologies and content, so don&#8217;t need any excuse to delve into those areas. From self deprecation to humble bragging&#8230;

I love giving feedback because it shames me into following my own advice. &#8220;I can&#8217;t say that if *I&#8217;m* not doing it,&#8221; I think to myself. Giving feedback is a mirror to my own efforts.

Beyond self reflection is simple exercise. Flexing the thinking muscle [sharpens the saw][1] and give me new perspectives and inspiration

Beyond all self improvement is making and building friendships. Friends in need of feedback are friends indeed. Friends are great and the win-win of helping them with feedback is the winningest of the win-wins.

I&#8217;m rewriting CS Workflow&#8217;s website content because of giving feedback to on someone else&#8217;s website. This will lead to a redesign. Of course, the content updates are based on feedback selflessly shared by others.
