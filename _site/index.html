        Birthing a Content Strategy
      </a>
    </h2>

    <span class="post-date"><span class="icon-clock"></span>25 December 2013</span>

    <p><em>This post is part of a creative, generous effort in the content strategy community called <a target="_blank" href="http://secretsanta.csworkflow.com/">Blog Secret Santa</a>. Many thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/mbloomstein">Margot Bloomstein</a> for the <a href="https://twitter.com/mbloomstein/status/395969851820220416" target="_blank">germ of the idea</a>, and to Ben Chadfield for taking it to fruition, expanding it into a community of 50 content strategy bloggers. I am honored to have gotten Ben as my Blog Secret Santa outlet! – Currently anonymous guest blogger</em> </p>

<p>I always say that launching a website is like having a baby: There’s an amazing amount of preparation needed in advance, but once it launches you have this BABY that requires attention, guidance, discipline, and affection. Every. Single. Day. Since Ben is a new parent, I wanted to tie the two together. </p>

<p>For the most part, the post-launch work of any digital property is executing the content strategy. Therefore, the upfront effort to create a sound, smart content strategy is key to ongoing – and ideally, increasing – success for the site. </p>

<p>In the name of taking a metaphor to its logical conclusion, here are the four stages of birthing a content strategy: </p>

<p><strong>Phase 1. Conception</strong> </p>

<p>A content strategy usually starts with a problem (the most common one in my experience being “no one can find anything on our site”), a redesign, or a new microsite. It’s followed by the decision to undertake the content strategy and getting the right resources in place. Then, voila – you’re on your way! (You can use your imagination in translating these concepts to conceiving a baby.) </p>

<p><strong>Phase 2. Gestation</strong> </p>

<p>Understanding the conditions: How do things work now (who is publishing content? who is reviewing it? what is causing the problems)? What is successful and where are improvements needed? After these are identified, they all need to be prioritized. </p>

<p>Formation: For a content strategy, this is the audit and the development of the editorial guidelines, voice and tone, lifecycle, and governance. </p>

<p>Refinement: To make sure the content strategy can actually survive, its elements need to be tested on real content and with real content authors. </p>

<p><strong>Phase 3. Labor</strong> </p>

<p>Now it’s time to prepare for the content’s entry into the world. Where will the content guidelines be stored, and what’s the plan for ongoing communications, education, community, success stories, and reporting? </p>

<p><strong>Phase 4. Delivery</strong> </p>

<p>In addition to the launch of the new digital product, everyone involved in creating, reviewing, and publishing the content needs to know what the strategy is and how it will work. (If only parenting came with a rule book too!) They need to be held accountable for their input, their effort, and the results. </p>

<p>Congratulations: You are now the parent of a bouncing new website, and a shiny content strategy. Get ready – it will be a bumpy ride with loss of sleep, stressful moments, and even a few failures. But there will also be brilliant successes, swells of love, and rewards of all sizes and types along the way. Once you see the first glimmer of recognition (the website equivalent of that first true smile), you’ll know your efforts have been worthwhile!</p>

        I&#8217;m not a content strategist
      </a>
    </h2>

    <span class="post-date"><span class="icon-clock"></span>03 December 2013</span>

    <p>Over the last dozen or so years I’ve worked for quite a few companies and on an uncountable (because who can remember) number of digital projects. As you would hope, I did learn things.</p>

<p>The problem is that I don’t know what I am. My role in CS Workflow is Founder. That just means that I do everything needed to get my startup out of obscurity.</p>

<p>This post, and any subsequent posts that follow the same title pattern, are explorations to try to figure out what I am. I figure looking at what I’m not is a good way to cross things off the list.</p>

<p>I’m starting with content strategy and the ‘ist’ of that for two reasons.</p>

<p>The first is Blog Secret Santa (<a href="http://contentistheweb.com/magic-internet-santa/" target="_blank">read about how that got started</a>). Being involved with a bunch of real deal content strategists, with the possibility of anonymously sharing content with one of them, showed that I’m not in that club. That’s not because I’m not welcome, but because their CS cred is so strong.</p>

<p>The other reason to start with this specialty is that I’m always looking for content strategists to share the CS Workflow message with. This feels a bit awkward to say, but there are a lot of people who inflate their content strategy expertise. I didn’t want to be one of those people falsely claiming the latest trendy skill set. It’s unfair to the real experts.</p>

<p>I create content, but I’m not a content strategist. I have even created content strategies, but I’m still not a content strategist. A content strategist, at least in my view, has a specialist focus in content strategy, either creating, managing execution or furthering the field.</p>

<p>There isn’t a single definition of content strategy. If you want a good description then check out the often referenced <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/thedisciplineofcontentstrategy" target="_blank">The Discipline of Content Strategy</a> by Kristina Halvorson.</p>

<p>I’m not comfortable claiming that specialty, because the most obvious attribute of the real deal content strategists is focus. It’s also obvious that this focus comes from passion for content strategy, and content in general. I share the passion, but not the focus.</p>

<p>At the moment, about 80% of my time is spent on the CS Workflow product. This is mainly development time, including gathering feedback and planning next steps. The remaining time I have is split between content and trying to get people to use the product.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I’m not in this alone. My lovely wife and partner, Vicky, is flying the content banner. Her background is in educational publishing. Her passion and focus is far more diverse than my own.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Through CS Workflow and working with Vicky, I might eventually become focused enough to call myself a content strategist. However, I can’t see our team dynamic changing, or a reduction in development work. With Vicky able to spend more and more time on content (did I mention we have a six-month-old daughter) my focus is likely to only shift more to the product.</p>

<p>Keep an eye out for the CS Workflow blog. The content we’ll produce aims to educate people about content strategy, particularly the workflow and governance component.</p>

        Why I love giving feedback
      </a>
    </h2>

    <span class="post-date"><span class="icon-clock"></span>22 November 2013</span>

    <p>I suck at following my own advice. <a href="http://csworkflow.com" target="_blank">CS Workflow’s website</a> is pretty bad, we’re not active on social media and the amount of content we’re producing is only slightly more than none (there’s good stuff in the pipeline).</p>

<p>I seem to forget the basics when working on my own projects. For an example on top of the one’s already given, I forgot to add authorisation to <a href="http://secretsanta.csworkflow.com" target="_blank">Blog Secret Santa</a> to stop people being able to edit each other’s account details. I fixed that a couple of hours after it went live, but still.</p>

<p>The point of this post wasn’t self deprecation, it was to remind myself of how much I get from giving other people feedback. I generally give feedback with the selfless intention of making the world better. I love startups, internet technologies and content, so don’t need any excuse to delve into those areas. From self deprecation to humble bragging…</p>

<p>I love giving feedback because it shames me into following my own advice. “I can’t say that if <em>I’m</em> not doing it,” I think to myself. Giving feedback is a mirror to my own efforts.</p>

<p>Beyond self reflection is simple exercise. Flexing the thinking muscle <a href="https://www.stephencovey.com/7habits/7habits-habit7.php">sharpens the saw</a> and give me new perspectives and inspiration</p>

<p>Beyond all self improvement is making and building friendships. Friends in need of feedback are friends indeed. Friends are great and the win-win of helping them with feedback is the winningest of the win-wins.</p>

<p>I’m rewriting CS Workflow’s website content because of giving feedback to on someone else’s website. This will lead to a redesign. Of course, the content updates are based on feedback selflessly shared by others.

        What I learnt from my old boss that made me quit
      </a>
    </h2>

    <span class="post-date"><span class="icon-clock"></span>31 October 2013</span>

    <p>I resigned from my job nearly two months ago. We had recently hired someone that could easily step up into the vacancy I was leaving, so I could handover and be out of there quickly. There were lots of reasons for resigning. The main one was that my wife needed more help raising our baby daughter. Spending all that time at work, while my wife was struggling alone just didn’t make sense. </p>

<p>After a couple of months of being home with my family and working on getting <a href="http://csworkflow.com" target="_blank">CS Workflow</a> ready for people to check out, I have had time to reflect. </p>

<p>There are three key lessons I learnt from my ex-boss. All three lessons contributed to me quitting. </p>

<h4 id="there-is-no-tomorrow">There is no tomorrow</h4>

<p>My boss used this phrase to create a sense of urgency. To me it meant to do whatever we were discussing right away. To do something right away, or as quickly as possible, I had to strip the task down to the bare essentials, so that no time was wasted. This would result in a balancing act of meeting the time expectations and putting something to the market that I could be happy with. </p>

<p>More often that not, my professional pride for crafting things to a high standard and with best practices didn’t matter as much I thought, going by the results. Usually that professional pride comes from imagining my peers judging my work. </p>

<p>“There is no tomorrow” forced me to focus on what’s important. In a small business that’s the customer and making sales as soon as possible. Waiting until tomorrow means one more day that revenue isn’t coming in. </p>

<p>This led me to resign because one more day of my wife struggling at home alone was one too many. </p>

<p>Act now. </p>

<h4 id="have-the-end-in-mind">Have the end in mind</h4>

<p>My boss used this phrase to remind me that everything needed a purpose. I am goal oriented anyway, but I like this phrasing. </p>

<p>It’s very easy to lose sight of the end when juggling lots of competing priorities with limited resources. The trap becomes doing whatever is necessary to check tasks off the list. </p>

<p>“Have the end in mind” links to the previous lesson, because it provides the context to be able to judge what is important. </p>

<p>This led me to resign because I knew as Marketing Director I could help achieve 10 times growth for his company. Achieving this would take at least two years of my life. The end would be everything I learnt along the way and the reputation of the achievement, which would make it easier for me to get my own company off the ground, which is my real goal. </p>

<p>However, why invest in his company when I can invest in my own company now. In two years the things I will have learnt on my own will be more relevant to my real goal. Starting a business now has big risks, but there is no guarantee that working with my boss would significantly increase my chances of success. </p>

<p>Know why. </p>

<h4 id="be-brazen">Be brazen</h4>

<p>This wasn’t a phrase used by my boss. It was how he acted and was clearly evident in the decisions he made. </p>

<p>For example, there’s a line in marketing that marks the edge of what’s considered acceptable by customers and prospects. Crossing that line can be damaging to a brand. My boss didn’t think about that line and pushed to go beyond it. Again, crossing that imaginary line never really mattered. In fact, the results were usually positive.</p>

<p>What I learnt was to be less fearful of taking risks and to not place arbitrary lines between possible and impossible. </p>

<p>This led to me resigning, because I stopped worrying about the perception and impact on my relationships at work. Instead, I let my actions be guided by my goals and decided to trust that my heart knew best. </p>

<p>Don’t be led by fear.</p>

        Be careful what you say about your competition

    </h2>

    <span class="post-date"><span class="icon-clock"></span>23 June 2013</span>

    <p>People don’t like it when someone is attacked, especially when the attack seems unjustified or there’s an underdog being attacked. This is a reasonably common human trait that still operates in the world of business.</p>

<p>So, if you are up against a competitor with a prospective customer you should tread carefully. I’d recommend that your proposal talks about only about the way you’ll solve their problem. Remember that part of the problem they have is in choosing a solution amongst different vendors. Build trust in your brand and solution.</p>

<p>Don’t go cross the line into slamming the competition. This erodes trust very quickly. You don’t know the relationships the prospect has or where that information will end up. You had better hope all the facts you used about the competition are totally squared away.</p>

<p>Be a company others want to do business with. And stop helping the competition.</p>
