        Getting selected text with Rails and Turbolinks
      </a>
    </h2>

    <span class="post-date"><span class="icon-clock"></span>06 June 2013</span>

    <p>I have to start by confessing that I don’t know what it is about Turbolinks that caused the issue I was having. I’m only edu-guessing that Turbolinks is the cause.</p>

<p>So…I needed to know the text that the user had selected with their cursor. This would be used to create context for the comment they wanted to make on the text. I started by using <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5379120/get-the-highlighted-selected-text" target="_blank">a popular method I found on Stack Overflow</a>.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">getSelectionText</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">window</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">getSelection</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nb">window</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">getSelection</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="nx">toString</span><span class="p">();</span>
  <span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">selection</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">selection</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">type</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Control&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">selection</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">createRange</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="nx">text</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This worked fine in a static proof of concept. It also initially worked in my Rails project. By initially I mean after a browser refresh. As soon as I navigated to other pages and retested the function fell through and returned nothing. The rest of my javascript is fine. I am displaying a positioned button after text is selected and once clicked, the button performs an action with the selected text. This all works as expected.</p>

<p>I don’t know enough about the DOM or getSelection method to figure it out on my own. I set Google on it, which turned up a <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/292159/Javascript-code-to-get-selected-text" target="_blank">different function from the rest</a>.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">GetSelectedText</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">selectedText</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span>

      <span class="nx">selectedText</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">activeElement</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">value</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">substring</span><span class="p">(</span>
        <span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">activeElement</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">selectionStart</span>
        <span class="p">.</span> <span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">activeElement</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">selectionEnd</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">selectedText</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>That is now working. Or at least it fixes my previous bug. It’s the nested if where selectedText is blank that solves it. I don’t like the if else in the selectedText initiation so I’m using the original function is start with.</p>

        My pillars of marketing strategy
      </a>
    </h2>

    <span class="post-date"><span class="icon-clock"></span>27 April 2013</span>

    <p>I keep coming back to the same three pillars when developing marketing strategies. This is regardless of industry, company size, customer type, and channel. These pillars are awareness, engagement and innovation. There’s nothing complicated or ground-breaking here, just a simple structure I like to work with.</p>

<h3 id="awareness">Awareness</h3>

<p>Awareness covers all growth-focused activities, like attracting new customers and spreading the brand. Examples are SEO, paid search and press releases. Success metrics depend on the business model, but could include new registrations, total site traffic, search traffic, or social mentions. And yes, those are vanity metrics. Awareness on its own won’t lead to success.</p>

<h3 id="engagement">Engagement</h3>

<p>Engagement covers all conversion and satisfaction-focused activities. Engagement aims to move customers further along from having some initial interest to being paid customers and beyond. Examples are having a sales website, customer support, trial onboarding experience, and educational newsletters. Generally success metrics are paying customers, monthly/weekly active users and satisfaction scores, like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Promoter" target="_blank">net promoter score</a>. Again this depends on the business model.</p>

<h3 id="innovation">Innovation</h3>

<p>Innovation is the positive reminder to solve my own problems. It’s very easy to copy what competitors are doing or what was in an article someone successful wrote. Common wisdom and current trends only go so far. Creativity and rigorous scientific execution are the next level shit.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>All very straight-forward. It’s all about answering these questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How will new people find out about my company?</li>
  <li>How will I convert them to customers and keep them happy?</li>
  <li>What best suits my budget, customers and company?</li>
</ul>

        Attaching PDFs to emails with Prawn and Rails
      </a>
    </h2>

    <span class="post-date"><span class="icon-clock"></span>31 March 2013</span>

    <p>Yesterday I released a very simple tool to help copywriters get better briefs. I had a couple of days dev time up my sleeve while other parts of the main <a href="http://csworkflow.com" target="_blank">CS Workflow</a> project are getting worked on.</p>

<p>What I ended up with was a simple signup for copywriters. This generates a token that, when part of a URL, associates the brief with the copywriter. The briefs are a tableless model and are only saved as an attached PDF that is sent to the copywriter. Simple.</p>

<p>I decided to use Prawn over the other options after watching the <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/153-pdfs-with-prawn-revised" target="_blank">railscast</a> (requires pro subscription) on the topic. It gave me the most control over the rendered PDF. For this project I used Rail 4.0.0.beta1.</p>

<p>To start I added Prawn to my Gemfile and ran bundle. The latest version was 0.12.0 at writing.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">&#39;prawn&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;~&gt; 0.12.0&#39;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>I found out that through an error message that Rails 4 already has the PDF mimetype registered, so that part of the railscast can be skipped.</p>

<p>I rendered a test PDF in the browser so I could make sure it looked how I wanted before attaching it to an email. Refreshing the browser displayed the changes. To get this working I created a ‘test’ action in my briefs controller and added that as a route.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">test</span>
  <span class="vi">@brief</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Brief</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">test_brief</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="vi">@user</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">User</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">find_by_email</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;ben@csworkflow.com&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="n">respond_to</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="nb">format</span><span class="o">|</span>
    <span class="nb">format</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">pdf</span> <span class="k">do</span>
      <span class="n">pdf</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">BriefPdf</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="vi">@brief</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="vi">@user</span><span class="p">)</span>
      <span class="n">send_data</span> <span class="n">pdf</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">render</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">filename</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;brief_</span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="vi">@brief</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
                            <span class="ss">type</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;application/pdf&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
                            <span class="ss">disposition</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;inline&quot;</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Following the same pattern as the railscast, I created a <a href="https://gist.github.com/bchadfield/5274166" target="_blank">BriefsPdf class</a> that inherited from Prawn::Document. This initializes, taking the arguments, which are my objects, then calls methods that render boxes and text. It’s a bit hacked together, but you get the picture. I kept the <a href="http://chadfield.org/assets/brief.pdf" target="_blank">testing output</a>, so that’s what the class renders.</p>

<p>The biggest “gotcha” I came across was with using bounding boxes and text boxes. The cursor, which moves down the page as it renders, behaves differently with those boxes. I ran into trouble with my two bounding boxes, because if the cursor is moved to the bottom of the right box. If the left box is higher I got overlap. With text boxes the cursor doesn’t move down at all. You have to move it manually with move_down. This is fine if you know the height of the box. With user input you don’t have control. That’s why I’m not using text boxes.</p>

<p>The mailer is the simplest part of the whole process.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">send_brief</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">brief</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">user</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>I’m using a dynamic file name for the PDF, so the client and copywriter have a reference. The actual attachment is a single line.</p>

<p>There you have it. I’ll be using this same technique for creating invoices and subscription agreements.</p>

    <p>MailGuard is at the end of the hiring process for a new junior marketing assistant. We were looking for someone with less than a year’s experience to help with some cool stuff and be cheap. The candidates that made it to my desk had already made it past the first hurdle. I had a dozen or so applications to review.</p>

<p>Oh dear.</p>

<p>The best advice I can give is prove you are interested in the discipline you are being hired for. This applies ten times if you don’t have if any experience. A blog is the best way to do this because it shows me your personality, thought process and passions. Portfolios and Github commits show off your skills, but not who you are. When I’m hiring at this junior level, I’m looking for someone to mentor and invest time in. I only want to mentor someone that is interested and invested in their own development.</p>

<p>Your degree puts you on equal footing with everyone else. How are you proving that you’re better!?</p>

<p>I’ll make it easy for you. You only need to start blogging in your last year of studies. By this time you should know what kinds of jobs you want. Content matters, not design. Write about a topic you studied. Write about related news. Write about companies you like. Do that once a month.</p>

<p>Make me excited to get you in for an interview. Please.</p>

        Shutting down Dibbist: mistakes and lessons
      </a>
    </h2>

    <span class="post-date"><span class="icon-clock"></span>18 March 2013</span>

    <p>Recently I posted about the results of my <a href="http://chadfield.org/work/my-experiment-with-cold-calling/" title="My experiment with cold calling" target="_blank">cold call experiment</a> for Dibbist. Last week I closed down the online appointment service. I made that decision because I had made a lot of mistakes and wanted to do it right with <a href="http://csworkflow.com" title="CS Workflow landing page" target="_blank">CS Workflow</a>. So what were these mistakes?</p>

<p> </p>

<h2 id="mistakes">Mistakes</h2>

<h3 id="not-understanding-assumptions">Not understanding assumptions</h3>

<p>Dibbist was designed to bring the technologies and best practices of web and mobile development to small businesses. It allowed service businesses to take appointments and promote their services online. These are things that small businesses should be doing and care about. However, I didn’t look at the assumptions I’d made. Did businesses care? Were businesses looking for ways to improve their operations and marketing? The reality was that both assumptions were false. The businesses in my segment were focused on serving their clients and not on technology or marketing.</p>

<p>The funny thing is that I didn’t even consider I was making assumptions. From my perspective, I was building a service that was needed, whether prospects knew it or not. Success was just a matter of effective marketing. This led to a poor product-market fit. It even meant I didn’t have a clear market. This was the biggest mistake by far and could really be the summary of Dibbist’s failure.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3 id="unconfirmed-marketing-channels">Unconfirmed marketing channels</h3>

<p>I’m a product guy, so I focused on where I felt comfortable. I did have a plan to attract traffic through SEO, blogging and reaching out to industry associations. But before launch I made no effort to build traffic or understand how associations worked. Bad move. Building traffic takes time. Associations are generally administrative outfits and aren’t focused on helping their members. Instead they prefer you to advertise, which is very expensive when compared to online advertising.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3 id="unbalanced-co-founder-commitment">Unbalanced co-founder commitment</h3>

<p>My co-founder worked full-time and wasn’t able to commit much time to Dibbist. This meant I had all the downsides of having a co-founder (conflicting opinions, reduced equity) and none of the upsides (shared workload, support). My co-founder was a long-time friend, who I felt I couldn’t fire. We had also a simple partnership, which meant 50/50 ownership, with no vesting or other provisions.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2 id="lessons">Lessons</h2>

<p>Some of the lessons are direct responses to my mistakes and some are things I wish I knew a year ago.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3 id="work-through-assumptions">Work through assumptions</h3>

<p>Assumptions need to be identified and assessed before doing anything. This is a scientific process of stating the hypotheses and methods to test them. Everyone that knows anything understands this. However, very few people do it. Almost everyone I know involved in startups have untested assumptions, or think assumptions will be sorted out at launch. After Dibbist, and a few other projects, I now won’t do anything until all key assumptions are confirmed to be true. Any assumptions proved false mean a rethink and a pivot.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3 id="talk-to-customers">Talk to customers</h3>

<p>This is part of working through assumptions, but also has so many benefits beyond that. I’m naturally shy and reserved, with some fear of talking to people I don’t know. In my mind it’s going to be awkward and I’ll come off looking stupid. I didn’t talk to customers at all with Dibbist. I started doing it with CS Workflow and everyone that I’ve reached out to has been really nice and helpful. I’ve asked what some pretty stupid questions, but have only received supportive. This is now my favourite part of building a startup.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3 id="build-an-audience">Build an audience</h3>

<p>I’m completely onboard with building an audience as most effective marketing method. I’m working on this now, and learning as I go. I’m focused on adding value and communicating with my small audience as much as possible.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3 id="be-a-one-man-band">Be a one man band</h3>

<p>Since my experience with Dibbist I’ve been very cautious about co-founding. I’ve quit projects where the co-founder relationship isn’t ideal. Now it’s so unlikely that I will find a suitable co-founder that I’m not even going to try. I also don’t feel like I need one. I have a pretty good support network of experts and advisors. My wife, Vicky, helps to lighten the workload. For me, going solo is the ultimate in bootstrapping.</p>

<h3 id="have-a-clear-strategy">Have a clear strategy</h3>

<p>A clear strategy sets the direction against which all decisions and priorities can be tested. This is how I make sure I don’t waste time. There are so many distractions and so much advice that unless I ruthlessly stick to my vision weeks can fly by without any progress made.</p>

<h3 id="know-your-brand">Know your brand</h3>

<p>Most people think brand is about logo and colour scheme. Brand is really about the identity of your company. I think this important because it creates a personality and set of values that I can get behind and promote. Without a defined brand there’s a tendency to fill the void with the founders own values, which may or may not align well with the expectation of the market.</p>

<h3 id="design-is-about-user-flows">Design is about user flows</h3>

<p>I had the privilege of working with some great UX specialists. This biggest thing I picked up is to focus on user flow through the use cases. Doing this, instead of starting with wireframes, creates a more comprehensive solution that makes sense from start to finish.</p>

<p>These are the main lessons from my year with Dibbist that have been seared on my brain. I plan to write a series of posts to cover these topics and more in more detail. I’ll focus on the one man band theme. The aim is to help others and get feedback from more experienced people to build up my own knowledge.</p>
