    <p>Copywriters can now register their interest for <a href="http://csworkflow.com" target="_blank">CS Workflow</a>. You can do that here: <a href="http://csworkflow.com" target="_blank">http://csworkflow.com</a>.</p>

<p>I’m building an application specially for copywriters to make the review and approval process as painless as possible. If you’re a copywriter or have managed content projects, you’ll know how hard it is to get good feedback from reviewers and compile all that feedback into changes.</p>

<p>CS Workflow will manage the process, guiding and teaching reviewers how to give great feedback. It is a web-based application, so it accessible from any Internet-enabled device. Integration with other services and platforms is straightforward, making importing and publishing content easy.</p>

<p>This service is inspired by a blog post by my good friend Max Johns about <a href="http://contentistheweb.com/giving-and-receiving-expert-feedback-on-web-copy" target="_blank">giving and receiving web copy feedback</a>.</p>

<p>The next step is a closed beta to perfect the feature set and process flow. Register you interest to receive an invite.</p>

<p>Feedback is always welcome and I’d love to hear more stories about your specific review situation. Email me at ben@csworkflow.com</p>

        My experiment with cold calling
      </a>
    </h2>

    <span class="post-date"><span class="icon-clock"></span>02 March 2013</span>

    <p>My first real product was launched last year. <a href="https://www.dibbist.com" target="_blank">Dibbist</a> is an online appointment system for small businesses. I’ve failed to attract any subscribers and I know all the reasons why. I’ll do an more in depth post about what I did wrong. This post is about my cold calling experiment for Dibbist.</p>

<p>I have connections to an owner of a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process_outsourcing" target="_blank">BPO</a> (business process outsourcing) company. BPOs are always looking for ways to make money. One way is to find an easy to sell product and cold call to a script, taking commission on generated leads. My connection was happy to see if it was possible to sell Dibbist. The purpose of the cold call was to propose a trial to the contacts. This was pretty straight forward. I created a call flow and a detailed fact sheet that provided everything someone would need to talk through the product.</p>

<p>The arrangement was $2 for each generated lead (someone agreeing to a trial), plus $1 if the lead actually signed in. 20% commission would be paid if the lead when on to subscribe. The commission would apply to the first year of the subscription.</p>

<p>I already had contact lists from scraping the national yellow pages. This gave me phone numbers, and for some websites and email addresses. I went through the lists and pulled out any businesses from the list that both fit Dibbist and I could find a contact name.</p>

<p>During the 3 day trial the agent called 159 contacts. 13 agreed to a trial. 2 of those 13 provided fake email addresses.</p>

<p>I provisioned the 11 leads in Dibbist and sent a welcome email, which guides them to log in to their account. None have. 1 of the contacted businesses did come and check out the site.</p>

<p>Obviously this was a failure, but it was really interesting. Going through the contact list gave me a really good idea about the businesses in the market I was going after. I’d made assumptions that this research proved wrong.</p>

<p>The main thing this campaign confirmed is <a href="http://www.blueglass.com/blog/how-to-build-an-audience/" target="_blank">build an audience</a>.</p>

        PeepCode&#8217;s Ember tutorial is essential
      </a>
    </h2>

    <span class="post-date"><span class="icon-clock"></span>16 February 2013</span>

    <p>From my previous post on <a href="http://chadfield.org/work/my-progress-with-learning-mongo-and-ember" target="_blank">my learning progress</a>, you’ll know I was running through a few Ember tutorials. Through these I learnt a bit, but I wasn’t grasping Ember’s MVC concept with the single model example apps. I was starting to feel like an idiot.</p>

<p>Fortunately, an off topic comment on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com" target="_blank">Hacker News</a> lead to me pointing out the tutorial limitations. A kind gentleman pointed me to the <a href="https://peepcode.com/products/emberjs" target="_blank">Ember tutorial</a> on <a href="https://peepcode.com" target="_blank">PeepCode</a>. It was obvious from the description that this was exactly what I needed. There were screenshots of an example app with multiple associated models in the same view. Perfect.</p>

<p>Now that I’ve finished passively watching the lesson (not coding along), I know perfect is the perfect description. The tutorial didn’t only show how to create a multi-model app. That’s what I thought I needed. I really needed a solid explanation of the Ember basics. I needed to properly understand Ember’s MVC concept. I needed to be shown the automagic of Ember’s non-coding.</p>

<p>Summary: If you’re new to Ember start with <a href="https://peepcode.com/products/emberjs" target="_blank">PeepCode’s Ember tutorial</a>.</p>

    <p>About 10 days have past since we found out that we’re having a girl. We were waiting for over 3 months to find out. Waiting until the birth didn’t make sense. I still can’t imagine what it’s going to be like having this new person in our life. I’ve managed to avoid being around babies more almost my entire life. Vicky will make sure I’m not useless, and her family will be living in Melbourne by the time she’s due. That’s June, by the way. June 12th at this stage.</p>

<p>While I can’t imagine how our baby is going to change our lives, I do know I feel about it. I can imagine the presence of this perfect bundle of life’s potential. I can imagine the love, the joy and the challenges that will make life worthwhile and meaningful.</p>

<p>I can’t wait to meet you, darling</p>

        My progress with learning Mongo and Ember
      </a>
    </h2>

    <span class="post-date"><span class="icon-clock"></span>02 February 2013</span>

    <p>I’ve spent about 16 hours running through tutorials, reading and rebuilding <a href="http://www.poopee.com.au" target="_blank">Poopee</a>. This post will cover what I’ve learnt so far and how.</p>

<p>Poopee currently uses a MySQL database fronted by PHP that returns XML. The front-end is JQuery. My aim is to rebuild it with Mongo and Ember.</p>

<h3 id="a-hrefhttpwwwmongodborg-targetblankmongodba"><a href="http://www.mongodb.org/" target="_blank">MongoDB</a></h3>

<p>I’m comfortable with Mongo. I run through a basic <a href="http://tutorial.mongly.com/tutorial/index" target="_blank">interactive tutorial</a> at <a href="http://mongly.com" target="_blank">Mongly</a>. The main reason I wanted to use Mongo was that it had a simple way to handle <a href="http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/geospatial-indexes/" target="_blank">geospatial queries</a>. This was covered by Mongly with a <a href="http://tutorial.mongly.com/geo/index" target="_blank">geospatial tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>The next step was to learn how to use Mongo as part of an API. <a href="http://coenraets.org/blog/" target="_blank">Christophe Coenraets</a> has a good two-part tutorial on how to build a simple site with <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">Node.js</a>, <a href="http://expressjs.com/" target="_blank">Express</a>, Mongo and <a href="http://backbonejs.org/" target="_blank">Backbone</a>. The first part is a good guide on <a href="http://coenraets.org/blog/2012/10/creating-a-rest-api-using-node-js-express-and-mongodb/" target="_blank">building the API</a>, which I followed. The second is really a link to a github repository for the finished product. I used the first post to build the API for Poopee. That included importing the lastest batch of Australian Toilet data. Importing the XML data was the single task that I spent the most time on.</p>

<h3 id="a-hrefhttpemberjscom-targetblankembera"><a href="http://emberjs.com/" target="_blank">Ember</a></h3>

<p>Outside the day and a half I spent on the API, I read about the good, bad and the ugly of pretty much every javascript framework I could find. I settled on Ember as the framework that I’d tackle. Ember is popular enough to have documentation and good tutorials. The decision was a toss-up between <a href="http://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">Angular</a> and Ember. I rejected Angular because I didn’t like the way it extended HTML. I prefer to keep my HTML clean. Obviously, I can change my mind later, once I delve deeper into Ember. It’s highly likely I’ll end up using Backbone for Poopee, because it’s such a straight forward web app.</p>

<p>So far, I’ve spent my time coming to grips with the new (to me) concepts in Ember. After reading the <a href="http://emberjs.com/guides/" target="_blank">Ember guides</a>, the article/tutorial that I saw recommended was <a href="http://trek.github.com/" target="_blank">Advice on &#038; Instruction in the Use Of Ember.js</a>.</p>

<p>The next step is to run the <a href="http://reefpoints.dockyard.com/ember/2013/01/07/building-an-ember-app-with-rails-api-part-1.html" target="_blank">Ember and Rails tutorials</a>. The concept that I struggled with was how the API connection worked with the routing. I’m expecting this tutorial to help me understand that.</p>
